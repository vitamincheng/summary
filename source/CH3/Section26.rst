========================================================================

**Precondition:**

 | A 2 L round-bottom flask was charged with the specified solute
   and solvent, leaving approximately 1 L of air remaining
   in the flask.
 | solvent KF = 0.02 %
 | solid KF = 1.0 %

Example 1 : dilution liquid (50V solvent)
-----------------------------------------------------
 | 20 g solid is dissolved in 50V 1L solvent

 | *1L Air*
 |  maximum pressure of water vapor at 20\ :sup:`o`\ C = 17.5 torr
 |  17.5 (partial pressure) / 760  (total pressure) = 0.023 (ratio)
 |  1L x 0.023 = 0.023 L volume of water vapor
 |  0.023 L / 24.5  (L/mole)  =  0.000938776 mole = 0.939 mmole =
    16.9 mg H\ :sub:`2`\ O

 | *1L Solvent*
 |  1L = 1000 mL
 |  1000 mL x 0.02% (g/mL) = 0.2 g H\ :sub:`2`\ O = 200 mg H\ :sub:`2`\ O

 | *20 g Solid*
 |  20 g x 1.0% = 0.2 g = 200 mg H2O

 | *Molecule percentage (mole %) to solid equivalent*
 |  20 g solid = 20 g / (100g/mol) = 0.2 mole of solid
 |  16.9 mg weight of water in air    = 0.00093 mole of water in air
 |  0.2 g weight of water in solvnet  = 0.011 mole of water in solvent
 |  0.2 g weight of water in solid    = 0.011 mole of water in solid
 |  0.00093 mole of water in air   / 0.2 mole of solid = 0.47 % (mole %)
 |  0.011 mole of water in solvent / 0.2 mole of solid =  5.6 % (mole %)
 |  0.011 mole of water in solid   / 0.2 mole of solid =  5.6 % (mole %)

Conclusion
------------------------------------------------------------------

 | Theoretical calculations indicate that while maintaining 100%
   relative humidity in the flask's headspace, the total system
   moisture content would range from 1.4% to 4.0% (w/w). This
   moisture is predominantly attributed to residual water in
   the solvents and solids (95-98%), suggesting that controlling
   solvent and solid water content is paramount, rather than
   focusing on ambient humidity.
