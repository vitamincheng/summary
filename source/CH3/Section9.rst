 | For example, to preserve constant reaction selectivity on scale-up 
   for reactions exhibiting micromixing control, Bourne shows that Eqs. 1 
   and 2 are applicable (where nf is the number of feed ports and tf is the 
   feed time of reagent) for a competitive reaction sequence when able to 
   maintain geometric similarity and constant P/V (where P is power and V 
   is volume). Therefore, for a reaction exhibiting micromixing control, 
   the product quality and yield on large scale can be predicted and 
   controlled by manipulating the feed time and the number of feed ports 
   in the reactor. Occasionally mixing sensitivities can be designed out 
   of the process by sufficiently slowing the chemical kinetics down by 
   dilution or lowering the temperature such that mixing no longer 
   influences the product yield and quality. The trade-offs of productivity 
   versus scale dependence must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

 | This review offers an introduction to understanding how mixing influences 
   those single-phase and two-phase reactions which are sufficiently fast 
   that mixing cannot fully homogenize their reactants. It includes 
   theoretical principles, typical experimental results, worked examples, 
   and literature references for further study.

   It was shown that the best way is to increase the number of feed points 
   in the large vessel.
