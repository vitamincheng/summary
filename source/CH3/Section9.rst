 | For example, to preserve constant reaction selectivity on scale-up
   for reactions exhibiting micromixing control, Bourne shows that Eqs. 1
   and 2 are applicable (where nf is the number of feed ports and tf is the
   feed time of reagent) for a competitive reaction sequence when able to
   maintain geometric similarity and constant P/V (where P is power and V
   is volume). Therefore, for a reaction exhibiting micromixing control,
   the product quality and yield on large scale can be predicted and
   controlled by manipulating the feed time and the number of feed ports
   in the reactor. Occasionally mixing sensitivities can be designed out
   of the process by sufficiently slowing the chemical kinetics down by
   dilution or lowering the temperature such that mixing no longer
   influences the product yield and quality. The trade-offs of productivity
   versus scale dependence must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

 | This paper establishes links between the available turbulent mixing capability
   in a fed-batch reactor and important crystallization characteristics such as
   the metastable zone width and product nucleation during the
   anti-solvent crystallization of benzoic acid. As demonstrated an increase in
   locally dominant meso-mixing time scale facilitates the premature and
   subsequent sporadic nucleation of the solute.

 | This review offers an introduction to understanding how mixing influences
   those single-phase and two-phase reactions which are sufficiently fast
   that mixing cannot fully homogenize their reactants. It includes
   theoretical principles, typical experimental results, worked examples,
   and literature references for further study.
