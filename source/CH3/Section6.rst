Optimization of Solvent Chasing in API Manufacturing Process: Constant Volume Distillation. `10.1021/op800152n <https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/op800152n>`_ 

 | The constant volume mode can be more efficient as the chasing solvent acts as an effective displace by keeping concentrations of the solvent being displaced at higher levels.

 | *Chemical rate constants are scale independent, whereas physical parameters are not. This dichotomy is the primary cause of the failure to identify scale-up problems.*
 | *Most commonly interact with chemistry to cause a fall in performance on scale-up” to include processing time, heat transfer,  power  input,  gas  desorption,  phase  separation, mixing times, and mass transfer rates in two-phase systems.*
 | Mixing time
 | *macro-, meso, micromixing issues depending on the times scale of the reaction process*
 | *Mesomixing relates to the dispersal and disintegration of reagent plumes; the localized excess concentration that can result can have a great effect on conversion and product  distributions.*
 | *Whereas  macro-mixing is concerned with the blending time for the whole solution and is  of  the order of seconds to minutes, meso- and micromixing time scales are of the order of milliseconds.*
 | *The capability of the standard motor fitted of 7.5 kW*
 | *Hierarchy of potential scale-up obstacles*
 | *heat transfer time, mixing time, foam creation, and solid suspension*
