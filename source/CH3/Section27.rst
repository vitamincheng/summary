| To achieve a high monoester yield, which reagent is preferable:
  acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride? What level of control is needed
  over reagent addition timing and method? And why?
| 5 examples in Bourne paper [1]

Blending time
    Based on a practical, realistically
    achievable value such as 99% uniformity.

| Blending of miscible liquids happens slowly by **molecular diffusion**
  and **natural convection**. Thus, agitation systems
  can apply forced convection to obtain homogeneity more rapidly
  (Rushton, 1956) [2].
| Blending time is usually about 1 min in 1000 gal vessel under
  energy input W/I = 0.02 [3, page 247]

| **Power per unit volume (P/V)**
| Generally, either **power per unit volume (P/V) or torque per unit
  volume (Tq /V) should be held constant on scale-up**. Scale-up methods
  established on constant blend time demand that the agitation speed in
  the plant vessel be similar to that of the laboratory vessels [2].

Kolmogorov microscale
    The smallest scales in turbulent flow [6, page 20].

| Diffusion is generally regarded as a slow process. Within eddies of
  30~100um diameter, homogeneity is achieved in about 1s for low-viscosity
  fluids [5].

| **Mixing on Micro-scale** [6, page 20 and 21]
| Mixing sensitivity of competitive - consecutive fast reaction scheme
| Kinetics limit, show reaction regime Xs->0 and instantaneout reaction
  regime Xs->1
| Timescales of mixing - 3 different types and properties of Macro-mixing,
  meso-mixing and micro-mixing

| **Feed location on scale-up** [6, page 28]
| Xs is 0.03~0.06 if feed location is near the impeller zone
| Xs is about 0.22 if feed location is on the surface of mixture in vessel
| 3 different types of controlled addition reactions - addition tube
  (dip pipe), dispersion ring and spray nozzle [3, page 258].
| Spray nozzle is desgined for sensitivity for temperature and dip pipe
  is designed for sensitivity for concentration. If your reaction is
  sensitiviy for temperature and concentration both, using the dispersion
  ring is first choice.

| **Screening experiments** [1]
| Sequence showing the minimum experiments which must be carried out
  (Figure 23). Stirrer speed, feed time, feed point position, number of
  feed points and viscossity of solution are used to identify the type of
  mixing.

| **Micro-mixing** [7]
| For example, to preserve constant reaction selectivity on scale-up
  for reactions exhibiting micromixing control, Bourne shows that Eqs.
  1 and 2 are applicable for a competitive reaction sequence when able
  to maintain geometric similarity and constant P/V.

| **Meso-mixing** [1]
| If mesomixing controls, requiring its time constant (ts) to be held
  constant, a difficulty can arise.
| the product distribution can only be held constant if the feed time
  is significantly extended with increasing vessel size. The penalty is
  now a substantial fall in productivity upon scale-up. It was shown that
  the best way out is to **increase the number of feed points** in the
  large vessel.

Conclusion
----------------------------

1. To dissolve the reagents in a solvent and quickly add them to the area near the impeller is first choice.
2. Acetyl anhydride is preferred over acetic chloride because the relationship
   between reaction time and blend time.
