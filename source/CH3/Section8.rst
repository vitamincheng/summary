 | *Blending of miscible liquids happens slowly by molecular diffusion and
   natural convection. Thus, agitation systems can apply forced convection
   to obtain homogeneity more rapidly (Rushton, 1956).*

 | *Liquid-liquid mixing is divided into miscible and immiscible liquid-liquid
   mixing (van de Vusse, 1955). The term ’’blending’’ is used to describe
   miscible liquid mixing, while the term ‘‘mixing’’ is used for dispersions
   of immiscible liquids or the formation of emulsions (Jakobsen, 2008;
   Rushton, 1956).*

 | *For example, the drop size distribution defines the interfacial area,
   which is frequently the restrictive factor for mass transfer, a
   fundamental factor for industrial systems and scale-up , or upon scale-up
   mixing time will be increased in the larger tank, although a larger
   impeller will reduce mixing time.*

 | *Dilute systems are the simplest systems to scale up. Many processes
   have been scaled profitably by employing following rule based on
   industrial experience.*
 |  *NDx = constant*
 | *It could be used for tanks with Reynolds number greater than 104, and
   vessels must be geometrically similar.*

 | *Over the years several criteria have been established for the optimal
   scale-up of stirred tanks based on similarities of geometries, dynamics,
   and kinematics.*
 | *Classically, geometric similarity and constant tip speed and, second,
   power input are commonly used.*

 | *Generally, either power per unit volume (P/V) or torque per unit volume
   (Tq/V) should be held constant on scale-up. Scale-up methods established
   on constant blend time demand that the agitation speed in the plant
   vessel be similar to that of the laboratory vessels.*

   | Utilizing this simple scale-up criterion of similar P/V across different scales, results obtained
     indicate fairly good reproducibility of the dissolution profiles
     between the two scales.

 | *Greatest misunderstanding about mixing is that a vortex on the
   surface is necessary for good mixing. In fact, the opposite is
   closer to the truth. Just as race cars moving around a track do
   not collide if they follow each other or move along parallel paths,
   radial mixing cannot occur if all of the liquid is moving in coherent
   rotation.*
