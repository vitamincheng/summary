 | *Unexpected incident that occurred during oxidation of sulfide to sulfoxide using m-CPBA (m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) as oxidant in DMF as a solvent on a pilot-plant scale. Investigation in the incident indicated that initial exotherm by m-CPBA in DMF, followed by formation of mCBPO (m-chlorobenzoyl peroxide) in a large amount, led to instability of the system.*

 | *Eventually, an N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)/tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) solvent system was identified, which provided an acceptable process while eliminating the use of DMSO and the associated decomposition reaction. This work shows some of the potential hazards that need to be investigated when using DMSO in a process.*
