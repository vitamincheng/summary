Quality Risk Assessment (QRA)
----------------------------------------------
QRA is an assessment of the risk of variation of material attributes (starting materials, etc.) and processes parameters to the CQAs of the associated API. It is a quantitative model often based on a failure mode, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA), which is used to facilitate the identification of those factors affecting the quality of the drug substance. Once the risks are identified, they can then provide clearer direction and attention for defining the design space and any subsequent control strategies that will be needed.
QRA is an assessment of the risk of variation of material attributes (starting materials, etc.) and processes parameters to the CQAs of the associated API.



The Quality Target Product Profile(QTPP)
-----------------------------------------------
| TPP - labeled use, safety and efficacy.
| QTPP - quality characteristics to ensure safety and efficacy as promised in the label.



Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs)
------------------------------------------------
CQA - A physical, chemical, biological, or microbiological property or characteristic that should be within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the desired product quality (ICH Q8)


Critical Material Attributes (CMAs)
--------------------------------------------------
| CMA - A physical, chemical, biological or microbiological property or characteristic of an input material that should be within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the desired quality of output material.
| \*CMA is not defined in ICH guidance

A quality evaluation strategy for multi-sourced active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) starting materials. *J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal.* **2006**, *41* (4), 1251-1259. `DOI: 10.1016/j.jpba.2006.03.013 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2006.03.013>`_

 | henyl methyl amino propanol (PMAP), a starting material that may be used for fluoxetine hydrochloride and atomoxetine hydrochloride, is used to illustrate the quality evaluation strategy. Knowledge of actual and potential synthetic routes was used to predict potential impurities and guide purity method development. Multiple analytical methods that were semi-orthogonal in the nature of impurity retention (ion-pairing, ion interaction and hydrophilic interaction chromatographicmodes)along with use tests were investigated.

 | The traditional approach to starting material identification and development has involved only two steps:
 | Provide minimal starting material information about the level and fate of impurities. Define and maintain tight specifications for starting material and drug substances to compensate for limited synthetic knowledge.

 | In contrast, the design space approach involves the following:
 | Select starting materials based on scientific understanding of the drug substance synthesis and available control mechanisms. Understand the source, formation, and fate of impurities. Understand how changes to the synthesis of the starting material may influence impurity profiles.

Critical Process Parameters (CPPs)
-----------------------------------------------------------

CPP - A process parameter whose variability has an impact on a CQA and therefore should be monitored or controlled to ensure the process produces the desired quality. (ICH Q8) 

By definition, any process parameter that impacts a CQA is a CPP; that is, it is a significant risk to the API quality. Usually, all process parameters are assessed and classified as either critical or non‐critical for the quality of both APIs and the isolated intermediates.

 | In this paper, we are proposing a method for determining the criticality of a process parameter and whether it should be listed in the common technical document as critical. By using routine process control capability across a variety of operating conditions and equipment configurations, a risk-based approach is used to identify parameters that could have a potential of impacting the CQAs of the API.
