 1. *Process optimization of an amidation reaction employing HOBt as a 
    reagent uncovered a hydrazide impurity associated with the quality 
    and quantity of HOBt used in the reaction.*
 2. *Follow-up studies suggested that commercial HOBt could be contaminated 
    with small but variable amounts of hydrazine. Development of a single 
    analytical method able to quantitate both hydrazine and 1-chloro-2-nitrobenzene 
    (two putative precursors) in HOBt allowed us to determine that hydrazine.*
