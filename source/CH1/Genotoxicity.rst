ICH M7
------------------------------------------------------------
| Option 1
| Include a test for the impurity in the drug substance specification with an acceptance criterion at or below the acceptable limit using an appropriate analytical procedure. For an Option 1 control approach, it is possible to apply periodic verification testing per ICH Q6A (Ref 10). **Periodic verification testing is justified when it can be shown that levels of the mutagenic impurity in the drug substance are less than 30% of the acceptable limit for at least 6 consecutive pilot scale or 3 consecutive production scale batches**. If this condition is not fulfilled, a routine test in the drug substance specification is recommended. See Section 8.3 for additional considerations.
| Option 4
| Understand process parameters and impact on residual impurity levels (including fate and purge knowledge) with sufficient confidence that the level of the impurity in the drug substance will be below the acceptable limit such that no analytical testing is recommended for this impurity. (i.e., the impurity does not need to be listed on any specification).

| 7.3.1. Clinical development
| An alternative approach to the strict use of an adjusted acceptable intake for any mutagenic impurity could be applied **for Phase 1 clinical trials for dosing up to 14 days. For this approach, only impurities that are known mutagenic carcinogens (Class 1) and known mutagens of unknown carcinogenic potential (Class 2)**, as well as impurities in the cohort of concern chemical class, should be controlled (see Section 8) to acceptable limits as described in Section 7.  All other impurities would be treated as non-mutagenic impurities.  This includes impurities which contain structural alerts (Class 3), which alone would not trigger action for an assessment for this limited Phase 1 duration.

| 9.1. Clinical trial application
| For Phase 1 studies of 14 days or less a description of efforts to mitigate risks of mutagenic impurities focused on Class 1, and Class 2 impurities and those in the cohort of concern as outlined in Section 7 should be included. **For Phase 1 clinical trials greater than 14 days and for Phase 2a clinical trials additionally Class 3 impurities that require analytical controls should be included.**
| **For Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical development trials, a list of the impurities assessed by (Q)SAR should be included, and any Class 1, 2 or 3 actual and potential impurities should be described along with plans for control. The in silico(Q)SAR systems used to perform the assessments should be described. The results of bacterial mutagenicity tests of actual impurities should be reported.**
