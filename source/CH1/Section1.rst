Design of Experiments (DoE)
================================================

| Six steps of Experimental Design: **Plan, Design, Perform, Analyze,
  Confirm and Evaluate.**


Screening or Characterization Experiments
--------------------------------------------
Full factorial design and Factional factorial design.

Find out the main effects and all interactions.

The first order model is only used to fit the data and reduce
the nubmers of variables.

Iterator or Sequential Experiments
--------------------------------------------
The box is not close the ideal area in most cases. Often iterator experiments
is necessary to trace to ideal regions.

The Method of Steepest Ascent (see Douglas C. Montgomery, Design and Analysis
of Experiments - Wiley (2017), Chapter 11.2).

Optimization Experiments
-------------------------------------------
Response surface design (RSM), central composite design (CCD)

To estimate main effects, interactions and quadratic effects.

second-order model is used to fit the curves.

see Douglas C. Montgomery, *Design and Analysis of Experiments* -
Wiley (2017), Chapter 10 Fitting Regression Models and
Chapter 11 Response Surface Methods and Designs.

Confirmation Experiments
----------------------------------------------
Repeated three times of experiments.

Robustness
----------------------------------------------
see Douglas C. Montgomery, *Design and Analysis of Experiments* -
Wiley (2017), Chapter 12 Robust Parameter Design and Process
Robustness Studies.

Mixture Experiments (Nested and split-plot Designs)
------------------------------------------------------

Definitive Screening Designs (DSDs)
--------------------------------------------------------
DSD provide the opportunity to combine screening and optimization
into a single step.

First stepwise regression (multiple linear regression) was used
identify the important terms, and then a simple regression model
built using just these terms.

Analysis of Design of Experiments with Dynamic Responses. *Org. Process

 | Sensitivity to the presence of water or air prior to the start
   of a DoE may be vital to successful analysis. If such a factor
   is difficult to control (e.g., oxygen  content), merely tracking
   a measured amount in each experiment may later prove helpful
   during data analysis.
 |
 | Selection of levels for each factor can prove challenging. If the
   ranges for each factor are too great and the factors prove to be
   significant, then the measured responses will vary greatly between
   each experiment and the results will be difficult to interpret.
 |
 | The ranges should be based upon historical experience. For example,
   varying temperature ±10°C is a reasonable choice since this would be
   relatively easy to control within this range at a commercial scale.
 |
 | **Type: virtual reaction**
 | Design: two-level fractional factorial design
 | Factor: (1) different stoichiometric amounts (2) solvent  volume
   (3) temperature (4) trace  amounts  of  water (5) mixing speed.
 | Responses measured: (1) > 90% yield pf product (2) minimize use of
   catalyst (3) < 6hr Cycle time
