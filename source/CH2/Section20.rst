 *We recommend the following 7 chiral acids and 14 chiral bases to be 
 included in Tier 1 screens.*
 
 *While the solubility of resolving agents does not correlate to ee 
 outcomes, solubility of the resultant salt is a key driver. We recommend 
 the following crystallization solvents to be included in Tier 1 screens: 
 6 solvents.*
