Preparation of [R-(R,S)] β-Methyl-α-Phenyl-1-Pyrrolidineethanol.
*Org. Synth.* **2000**, *77*, 12.
`DOI: 10.15227/orgsyn.077.0012 <http://www.orgsyn.org/demo.aspx?prep=V77P0012>`_

 *Preparation of the enantiomer has been reported. The method used
 potassium carbonate (K*\ :sub:`2`\ *CO*\ :sub:`3`\ *) as base,
 but the yield of the product was only 33%. The submitters have
 extensively studied the formation of the pyrrolidinyl ring under
 various conditions as summarized. Eventually they found that
 the reaction was extremely efficient when it was run in toluene
 using sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO*\ :sub:`3`\ *) as base, which
 gave [R-(R,S)]-β-methyl-α-phenyl-1-pyrrolidineethanol quantitatively.*

 sulfoxide using m-CPBA (m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid) as oxidant in
 DMF as a solvent on a pilot-plant scale. Investigation in the incident
 indicated that initial exotherm by m-CPBA in DMF, followed by formation
 of mCBPO (m-chlorobenzoyl peroxide) in a large amount, led to instability
 of the system.*
