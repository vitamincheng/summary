 | *The CFD result showed that adequate mixing was achieved within a short period of blend time. This mixing profile is similar to that observed in smaller development reactors.*

 | *Salt spiking experiments, addition rates, and various addition location experiments were performed to confirm the CFD models prior to the scale-up runs.*

 | *In-depth studies of reactor mixing is driven both by changes infill volumes of a particular reactor and changes in reactor design. In the inotuzumab ozogamicin case, a 5-fold change in scale necessitated an evaluation of mixing dynamics.*

 | Type: Conjugate
 | Design:
 | Factor: (1) antibody concentration on the conjugation mixture (3.8 to 29.6 mg/mL) (2) concentration of DMSO in the conjugation mixture (5 to 25% v/v) (3) temperature of the TCEP reduction step (5 to 40\ :sup:`o`\ C)
 | Responses measured: (1) aggregates (%) (2) HIC assay
