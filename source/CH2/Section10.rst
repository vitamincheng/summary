 1. *The CFD result showed that adequate mixing was achieved within a short
    period of blend time. This mixing profile is similar to that observed in
    smaller development reactors.*
 2. *Salt spiking experiments, addition rates, and various addition location
    experiments were performed to confirm the CFD models prior to the scale-up
    runs.*
 3. *In-depth studies of reactor mixing is driven both by changes infill
    volumes of a particular reactor and changes in reactor design. In the
    inotuzumab ozogamicin case, a 5-fold change in scale necessitated an
    evaluation of mixing dynamics.*

 1. Type: Conjugate
 2. Design:
 3. Factor:
