The data provided herein support the partitioning of tetraalkylammonium and tetraalkylphosphonium salts are dramatically affected by the identity of the cation, anion, and solvent, with demonstrated correlations between partitioning,various parameters of the cation, anion, and solvent, and solubility.*
