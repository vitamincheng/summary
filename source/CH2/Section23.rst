 | *The classes of behaviour observed are removal by washing, recrystallisation or reslurrying (Class 1), impurities not being removed by these operations (Class 2), and impurities which are removed in conjunction with a phase transformation (Class 3).*

Evaluation of Just-Suspended Speed Correlations in Lab-Scale Tanks with Varying Baffle Configurations. *Org. Process Res. Dev*. **2018**, *22* (11), 1481–1488.  `DOI: 10.1021/acs.oprd.8b00244 <https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.oprd.8b00244>`_

 | *To achieve the just-suspended speed, Njs, where all of the particles are suspended off the tank bottom. Operating at Njs results in high mass transfer between the solid and liquid phases, which is important because many solid−liquid operations rely on adequate mass transfer to achieve the goals of the operation (e.g., reaction completion in a heterogeneous reaction mixture).*

 | *Some interesting challenges for scale-up. For example, agglomeration can be avoided by operating at low impeller speed to generate low shear. However, impeller shear is required to maintain a suspension during the crystallization process. An alternative strategy for avoiding agglomerates could be to operate at a fast mesomixing time.*

 | *To achieve a fast mesomixing time, as it becomes increasingly difficult to homogeneously disperse the antisolvent due to the increased volumetric flow rate. Strategies such as multiple addition points and spray nozzles could help reduce the mesomixing time but may come with their own disadvantages.*

Trace Impurity of Organic Solvents

Peroxides in ethyl acetate. *Chemical & Engineering News* **2000** Vol. *78*, No. 51, page 2. `Link <http://pubsapp.acs.org/cen/safety/20001218.html?>`_

 | *We have also observed amines being oxidized to N-oxides, and Baeyer-Villiger-like oxidations. Therefore, it seems most likely that the peroxide impurity is peracetic acid formed by autooxidation of ethanol (from hydrolysis) to acetaldehyde and then to peracetic acid.*

Dichloromethane 1.Exposure Data – IARC Publications

 | *Purity, when reported, ranges from 99 to 99.99%. Acidity (as hydrochloric acid) may be up to 5 mg/kg. The maximum concentration of water in these grades of dichloromethane is 100 mg/kg.*

Chemical safety: peroxide formation in 2-propanol `Link <https://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i31/Chemical-safety-peroxide-formation-isopropanol.html>`_

 | *We suggest that diisopropyl ether, a well-known peroxidizable substance, formed during refluxing of 2-propanol with magnesium. Our results indicate that the first distillation performed without a Vigreux column was not sufficient, while an additional second distillation led to complete removal of all of the formed peroxidizable substance.*
